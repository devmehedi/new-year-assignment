                    Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock.

                <p>I am studying for a BSC pass from Chittagong College. I am very excited about programming. My idea about programming started in 2014. I have been struggling with this for about 1 year. Just Google and YouTube. Then I decide how to learn. Then I learned the basics of programming from youtube. Then I want to work with the front end. And let's enroll in a programming hero course to learn it. And finish the front-end course. And I do a lot of projects with a lot of fun. Where I have worked with many libraries and frameworks. And I have faced many obstacles. There is much more I can do to solve that. Doing so increases self-confidence. And I really enjoy programming. And I want to learn something new with real experience. I really enjoy learning new things about web development.</p>
